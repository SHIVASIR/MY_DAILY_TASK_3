# 🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction Web App

This project is a Machine Learning web application that predicts whether a passenger would survive the Titanic disaster based on input features such as age, gender, passenger class, fare, and other details.

This project was developed as part of my internship at MyDailyWork to apply supervised learning techniques and build an interactive ML-powered web application.
